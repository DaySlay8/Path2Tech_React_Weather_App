Description:

You will build a React application to display the weather and needs to have these following features:

On initial render, your app should load the weather details for the default location of choice
A search bar that allows a user to change the location and should allow the application to render weather forecast data for the new location
User should be able to enter a city/state, zip code, address, or landmark as a search term
Each componentâ€™s props should be destructured for readability.
Pull data from an external API using axios or fetch
Hide any API keys using a .env file
App should have multiple components
